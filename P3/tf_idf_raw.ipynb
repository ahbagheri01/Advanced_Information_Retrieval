      "Feature-based Sentiment Analysis on Android App Reviews Using SAS® Text Miner and SAS® Sentiment Analysis Studio\n",
      "Sentiment analysis is a popular technique for summarizing and analyzing consumers’ textual reviews about products and services. There are two major approaches for performing sentiment analysis; statistical model based approaches and Natural Language Processing (NLP) based approaches to create rules. In this study, we first apply text mining to summarize users’ reviews of Android Apps and extract features of the apps mentioned in the reviews. We then use NLP approach for writing rules. We use reviews of two recent apps; a widget app from Brain& Puzzle category and a game app from Personalization category. We extracted six hundred textual reviews for each app from Google Play Android App Store. SAS® Enterprise Miner TM 7.1 is used for summarizing reviews and pulling out features, and SAS® Sentiment Analysis Studio 12.1 is used for performing sentiment analysis. Our results show that for both apps, carefully designed NLP rule-based models outperform the default statistical models in SAS® Sentiment Analysis Studio 12.1 for predicting sentiments in test data. NLP rule based models also provide deeper insights than statistical models in understanding consumers’ sentiments.\n",

      "Mobile app stores are available in over 150 countries, allowing users from all over the world to leave public reviews of downloaded apps. Previous studies have shown that such reviews can serve as sources of requirements and suggested that users from different countries have different needs and expectations regarding the same app. However, the tremendous quantity of reviews from multiple countries, as well as several other factors, complicates identifying country-specific app feature requests. In this work, we present a simple approach to address this through NLP-based analysis and discuss some of the challenges involved in using the NLP-based analysis for this task.\n",

      "Mobile app developers today have a hard decision to make: to independently develop native apps for different operating systems or to develop an app that is cross-platform compatible. The availability of different tools and approaches to support cross-platform app development only makes the decision harder. In this study, we used user reviews of apps to empirically understand the relationship (if any) between the approach used in the development of an app and its perceived quality. We used Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to classify 787,228 user reviews of the Android version and iOS version of 50 apps as complaints in one of four quality concerns: performance, usability, security, and reliability. We found that hybrid apps (on both Android and iOS platforms) tend to be more prone to user complaints than interpreted/generated apps. In a study of Facebook, an app that underwent a change in development approach from hybrid to native, we found that change in the development approach was accompanied by a reduction in user complaints about performance and reliability.\n",

      "Real-time Analysis of Privacy-(un)aware IoT Applications\n",
      "Abstract Abstract: Users trust IoT apps to control and automate their smart devices. These apps necessarily have access to sensitive data to implement their functionality. However, users lack visibility into how their sensitive data is used, and often blindly trust the app developers. In this paper, we present IoTWATcH, a dynamic analysis tool that uncovers the privacy risks of IoT apps in real-time. We have designed and built IoTWATcH through a comprehensive IoT privacy survey addressing the privacy needs of users. IoTWATCH operates in four phases: (a) it provides users with an interface to specify their privacy preferences at app install time, (b) it adds extra logic to an app’s source code to collect both IoT data and their recipients at runtime, (c) it uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to construct a model that classifies IoT app data into intuitive privacy labels, and (d) it informs the users when their preferences do not match the privacy labels, exposing sensitive data leaks to users. We implemented and evaluated IoTWATcH on real IoT applications. Specifically, we analyzed 540 IoT apps to train the NLP model and evaluate its effectiveness. IoTWATcH yields an average 94.25% accuracy in classifying IoT app data into privacy labels with only 105 ms additional latency to an app’s execution.\n",

      "OASIS: prioritizing static analysis warnings for Android apps based on app user reviews\n",
      "Lint is a widely-used static analyzer for detecting bugs/issues in Android apps. However, it can generate many false warnings. One existing solution to this problem is to leverage project history data (e.g., bug fixing statistics) for warning prioritization. Unfortunately, such techniques are biased toward a project’s archived warnings and can easily miss newissues. Anotherweakness is that developers cannot readily relate the warnings to the impacts perceivable by users. To overcome these weaknesses, in this paper, we propose a semantics-aware approach, OASIS, to prioritizing Lint warnings by leveraging app user reviews. OASIS combines program analysis and NLP techniques to recover the intrinsic links between the Lint warnings for a given app and the user complaints on the app problems caused by the issues of concern. OASIS leverages the strength of such links to prioritize warnings. We evaluated OASIS on six popular and large-scale open-source Android apps. The results show that OASIS can effectively prioritize Lint warnings and help identify new issues that are previously-unknown to app developers.\n",

      "Supporting voice commands in applications presents significant benefits to users. However, adding such support to existing GUI-based web apps is effort-consuming with a high learning barrier, as shown in our formative study, due to the lack of unified support for creating multi-modal interfaces. We develop Geno---a developer tool for adding the voice input modality to existing web apps without requiring significate NLP expertise. Geno provides a unified workflow for developers to specify functionalities to support by voice (intents), create language models for detecting intents and the relevant information (parameters) from user utterances, and fulfill the intents by either programmatically invoking the corresponding functions or replaying GUI actions on the web app. Geno further supports references to GUI context in voice commands (e.g., \"add this to the playlist\"). In a study, developers with little NLP expertise were able to add the multi-modal support for two existing web apps using Geno.\n",

      "ReCDroid: Automatically Reproducing Android Application Crashes from Bug Reports\n",
      "The large demand of mobile devices creates significant concerns about the quality of mobile applications (apps). Developers heavily rely on bug reports in issue tracking systems to reproduce failures (e.g., crashes). However, the process of crash reproduction is often manually done by developers, making the resolution of bugs inefficient, especially that bug reports are often written in natural language. To improve the productivity of developers in resolving bug reports, in this paper, we introduce a novel approach, called ReCDroid, that can automatically reproduce crashes from bug reports for Android apps. ReCDroid uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and dynamic GUI exploration to synthesize event sequences with the goal of reproducing the reported crash. We have evaluated ReCDroid on 51 original bug reports from 33 Android apps. The results show that ReCDroid successfully reproduced 33 crashes (63.5% success rate) directly from the textual description of bug reports. A user study involving 12 participants demonstrates that ReCDroid can improve the productivity of developers when resolving crash bug reports.\n",

      "FlowCog: Context-aware Semantics Extraction and Analysis of Information Flow Leaks in Android Apps\n",
      "Android apps having access to private information may be legitimate, depending on whether the app provides users enough semantics to justify the access. Existing works analyzing app semantics are coarse-grained, staying on the app-level. That is, they can only identify whether an app, as a whole, should request a certain permission, but cannot answer whether a specific app behavior under certain runtime context, such as an information flow, is correctly justified. To address this issue, we propose FlowCog, an automated, flow-level system to extract flow-specific semantics and correlate such semantics with given information flows. Particularly, FlowCog statically finds all the Android views that are related to the given flow via control or data dependencies, and then extracts semantics, such as texts and images, from these views and associated layouts. Next, FlowCog adopts a natural language processing (NLP) approach to infer whether the extracted semantics are correlated with the given flow. FlowCog is open-source and available at https: //github.com/SocietyMaster/FlowCog. Our evaluation shows that FlowCog can achieve a precision of 90.1% and a recall of 93.1%.\n",

      "Finding Clues for Your Secrets: Semantics-Driven, Learning-Based Privacy Discovery in Mobile Apps\n",
      "A long-standing challenge in analyzing information leaks within mobile apps is to automatically identify the code operating on sensitive data. With all existing solutions relying on System APIs (e.g., IMEI, GPS location) or features of user interfaces (UI), the content from app servers, like user’s Facebook profile, payment history, fall through the crack. Finding such content is important given the fact that most apps today are web applications, whose critical data are often on the server side. In the meantime, operations on the data within mobile apps are often hard to capture, since all server-side information is delivered to the app in the same way, sensitive or not. A unique observation of our research is that in modern apps, a program is essentially a semantics-rich documentation carrying meaningful program elements such as method names, variables and constants that reveal the sensitive data involved, even when the program is under moderate obfuscation. Leveraging this observation, we develop a novel semantics-driven solution for automatic discovery of sensitive user data, including those from the server side. Our approach utilizes natural language processing (NLP) to automatically locate the program elements (variables, methods, etc.) of interest, and then performs a learning-based program structure analysis to accurately identify those indeed carrying sensitive content. Using this new technique, we analyzed 445,668 popular apps, an unprecedented scale for this type of research. Our work brings to light the pervasiveness of information leaks, and the channels through which the leaks happen, including unintentional over-sharing across libraries and aggressive data acquisition behaviors. Further we found that many high-profile apps and libraries are involved in such leaks. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the privacy risk in mobile apps and also highlight the importance of data protection in today’s software composition.\n"
